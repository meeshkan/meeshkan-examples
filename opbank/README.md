## Getting started

‚ö†Ô∏è**Prerequisites**:
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

Clone this repository and move into the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt-examples.git
cd hmt-examples
```

Once you're there, [create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). 

Then, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This command will install all of the necessary dependencies for the OP Bank API sandbox. Most importantly, this includes the [HTTP Mocking Toolkit (HMT)](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt) that will create the mock server and [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for running the tests.

Finally, move into the `opbank` directory:
```bash
cd opbank
```

### Starting the mock server

Run the following command to spin up your mock OP Bank server:
```bash
hmt mock ./specs/ --callback-dir ./callbacks/
```

> This command will use the OpenAPI specification located in the `specs` directory and the custom callbacks in the `callbacks` directory to create a mock server with HMT.

Keep this running because you'll need it to execute the tests.

### Running the tests

With your mock server running in another terminal window, you can run the tests with `pytest`:
```bash
pytest
```
