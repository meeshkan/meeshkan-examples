## Getting started

‚ö†Ô∏è**Prerequisites**:
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Setting up the repository

Clone this repository and move into the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt-examples.git
cd hmt-examples
```

Once you're there, [create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). 

Then, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, move into the `opbank` directory:
```bash
cd opbank
```

### Installing HMT

The HTTP Mocking Toolkit (HMT) is written in Python and available as a [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/hmt/). 

To install HMT via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), run:
```bash
pip install hmt
```

To make sure it's installed properly, run:
```bash
hmt --help
```

### Starting the mock server

Once HMT is installed, run the following command to spin up your mock OP Bank server:
```bash
hmt mock ./spec/openapi.yml
```

### Running the tests

You can run the tests with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/):
```bash
pytest
```
